    "The dominant factor is the role assignment part (O(M * N)) within the score() function.\n",
    "Therefore, the total time complexity of the provided code, excluding the main() function, is primarily governed by the role assignment part in the score() function and can be expressed as O(M * N). This represents the most significant operation in terms of time complexity for this code snippet.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I do not think that in general the time complexity is O(N * M). The reason is that the `score` function does not iterate over N candidates for each skill, but only over the candidates who are not already selected. Therefore, the number of iterations decreases as more candidates are selected. But in the worst case, the function may still need to check all N candidates for each skill, so the upper bound of the time complexity is O(N * M). However, this is not the exact time complexity, as it does not consider for the average or best case scenarios. For example, if the `score` function selects the best candidate for each skill in the first iteration, then the time complexity would be O(N), as it would not need to check any other candidates. So the time complexity of O(N * M * S) is a reasonable approximation, as it gives the upper bound of the worst case scenario."

So selecting a subset of individuals in the problem that covers all required skills T while minimizing effort corresponds to finding a solution to the set covering problem. This transformation can be done in polynomial time. If there exists a solution to the set covering instance, it translates to a solution to the problem. Specifically, if a subset of subsets in the set covering problem covers the universe, then the corresponding subset of individuals in the problem should cover all required skills T and have the minimum cost of working together. This equivalence can be checked in polynomial time. Proving successfully all of these, we can say that the problem is NP-hard and because we know that is also NP (because we can verify the solution in polynomial time), the problem is NP-complete."
